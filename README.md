Minecraft Server Controller 2.0

This is an update to my other repository, AMDGS Software. Instead of overwriting that entire repository, I decided to create a new one so that I could still go back to the old code for reference.

Despite the old code being in a running, working state, it is not capable of actually controlling a server due to problems I have encountered with Linux. The main issue is the lack of ability to interface with a running server once it is launched.
